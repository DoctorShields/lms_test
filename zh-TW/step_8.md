## Challenge: improve your band

Use what you've learnt in this project to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like — look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
play note (60) for (0.25) beats
```

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

You can use more sprites from the library, and you can also paint your own sprites!

## title: 為什麼我的角色在改變造型時會“跳躍”？

創建自己的角色時，可能會發現當你點擊角色時，它會一邊'跳轉'一邊改變造型。這是因為這兩套造型的中心位置不同。

To fix this, make sure that the centres of your sprite's costumes are the same.

If you have a microphone, you can record your own sounds, and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments!
