## What next?

Now that you've built your first Scratch project, why not have a go at the [Lost in Space](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lost-in-space/) project.

Alternatively, if you like the idea of doing more projects using sounds and music, then you could try out the Sonic Pi [Compose a tune](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/compose-tune) project.
