## Step 3: Making a Drum

Let's code your drum to make a sound when it's hit.

### Activity Checklist

+ Add code to your drum sprite, so that it makes a drum sound when hit.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
When your drum sprite is __clicked__, it should __play a drum__ sound.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You'll need to use a __play sound__ block and a __when this sprite clicked__ block.
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's the code you'll need:

{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ Click the drum to try out your new instrument!

## Challenge: Improving your drum

+ Can you change the sound that the drum makes when it's clicked?

+ Can you also get the drum to make a sound when the spacebar is pressed? You'll need to use this `event` block:

```blocks
	when [space v] key pressed
```

You can copy your existing code by right-clicking on it and clicking 'duplicate'.
