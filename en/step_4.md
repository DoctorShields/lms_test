## Making a drum

Let's code your drum to make a sound when it's hit.

You can find the code blocks in the Scripts tab, and they are all colour-coded!

Click on the drum sprite, and then drag these two blocks into the code area to the right, making sure that they are connected together (like Lego blocks):

--- no-print ---
