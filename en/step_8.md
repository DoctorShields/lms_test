## Step 5: Costumes

Let's make your singer look like she's singing!

+ You can also change how your singer sprite looks when it's clicked, by creating a new costume. Click the 'Costumes' tab, and you'll see the singer image.

+ Right-click on the costume and click 'duplicate' to create a copy of the costume.

+ Click on the new costume (called 'Singer2') and then select the line tool and draw lines to make it look like your singer is making a sound.

+ The names of the costumes aren't very helpful at the moment. Rename the 2 costumes to 'not singing' and 'singing' by typing the new name of each costume into the text box.

+ Can you use your singer's 2 costumes to make her look like she's singing?

    Test and save: When your singer is clicked, as well as playing a sound she should also look like she's singing.
