## Step 1: Sprites

Before you can start coding, you'll need to add in a 'thing' to code. In Scratch, these 'things' are called __sprites__.

+ Open a new empty Scratch project.

[[[new-scratch-project]]]
--- /collapse ---

+ Add a drum sprite to your project.

[[[add-sprite-from-library]]]
--- /collapse ---

+ Click the 'shrink' icon, and then click on the drum a few times to make it smaller.
