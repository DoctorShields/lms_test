## Step 1: Sprites

### Activity Checklist

[[[new-scratch-project]]]

+ Add the drum sprite from the Scratch library. (This doesn't need to be here if the next step has some context.)

[[[add-sprite-from-library]]]

+ Click the 'shrink' icon, and then click on the drum a few times to make it smaller.

## Step 2: The Stage

### Activity Checklist

+ At the moment, the stage is white, and looks pretty boring! Let's add a backdrop to the stage.

[[[backdrop-from-library]]]

+ Your stage should look like this:

## Step 3: Making a Drum

Let's code your drum to make a sound when it's hit.

### Activity Checklist

+ Add code to your drum sprite, so that it makes a drum sound when hit.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
When your drum sprite is __clicked__, it should __play a drum__ sound.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You'll need to use a __play sound__ block and a __when this sprite clicked__ block.
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's the code you'll need:
