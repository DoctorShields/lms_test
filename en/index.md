## Step 1: Sprites

### Activity Checklist

[[[new-scratch-project]]]

+ Add the drum sprite from the Scratch library. (This doesn't need to be here if the next step has some context.)

[[[add-sprite-from-library]]]

+ Click the 'shrink' icon, and then click on the drum a few times to make it smaller.

## Step 2: The Stage

### Activity Checklist

+ At the moment, the stage is white, and looks pretty boring! Let's add a backdrop to the stage.

[[[backdrop-from-library]]]

+ Your stage should look like this:

## Step 3: Making a Drum

Let's code your drum to make a sound when it's hit.

### Activity Checklist

+ Add code to your drum sprite, so that it makes a drum sound when hit.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
When your drum sprite is __clicked__, it should __play a drum__ sound.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You'll need to use a __play sound__ block and a __when this sprite clicked__ block.
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's the code you'll need:
![screenshot](images/drum-sound-solution.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

+ Click the drum to try out your new instrument!

## Challenge: Improving your drum

+ Can you change the sound that the drum makes when it's clicked?

![screenshot](images/band-drum-sound.png)

+ Can you also get the drum to make a sound when the spacebar is pressed? You'll need to use this `event` {.blockevents} block:

```blocks
	when [space v] key pressed
```

You can copy your existing code by right-clicking on it and clicking 'duplicate'.

# Step 4: Making a Singer

Let's add a singer to your band!

## Activity Checklist

+ Add another 2 sprites to your stage; a singer and a microphone.

	![screenshot](images/band-singer-mic.png)

+ Add the 'singer1' sound to your singer sprite.

[[[sound-from-library]]]

+ Once the sound has been added, add code to make the singer sing when clicked.

### Hint 1
{: .hint-heading #hint-1 }
When your singer sprite is __clicked__, it should __play__ the 'singer1' __sound__.
{: .hint-content .hint-1 }

### Hint 2
{: .hint-heading #hint-2 }
You'll need to use these blocks:
![screenshot](images/band-singer-blocks.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-2 }

### Hint 3
{: .hint-heading #hint-3 }
Here's the code you'll need:
![screenshot](images/band-singer-solution.png)
{: .hint-content .hint-3 }

# Step 5: Costumes

Let's make your singer look like she's singing!

## Activity Checklist

+ Create a second costume for your singer, and make it look as though she is singing. You should name your costumes 'not singing' and 'singing'.
