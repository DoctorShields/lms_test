## Sprites

Before you can start coding, you'll need to add in a 'thing' to code. In Scratch, these 'things' are called __sprites__.

First, open up the Scratch editor. You can find the online Scratch editor at [rpf.io/scratchon](http://rpf.io/scratchon){:target="_blank"}

Give your program a name by typing one into the text box in the top left-hand corner.

You can then click **File** and then **Save now** to save your project. If you don't have a Scratch account, you can save a copy of your project by clicking **Download to your computer** instead.
