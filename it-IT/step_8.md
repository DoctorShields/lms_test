## Sfida: Cambiare il costume del tamburo

Use what you've learnt in this project to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like — look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
play note (60) for (0.25) beats
```

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

You can use more sprites from the library, and you can also paint your own sprites!

## title: Perché il mio sprite "salta" quando cambia costume?

Creando il tuo sprite, potresti notare che quando fai clic sullo sprite, questo "salta" mentre cambia costume. Questo perché i due costumi non sono centrati nello stesso punto.

To fix this, make sure that the centres of your sprite's costumes are the same.

If you have a microphone, you can record your own sounds, and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments!
