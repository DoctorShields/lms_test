The names of the costumes aren't very helpful at the moment. Type into the text boxes of the costumes to change their names to 'not singing' and 'singing'.

Now that you have two different costumes for your singer, you can choose which costume is displayed! Add these two code blocks to your singer sprite:

```blocks3
pan gaiff y ciplun yma ei glicio
+newid gwisg i (singing v)
chwarae sain (Singer1 v) tan y diwedd
+newid gwisg i (not singing v)
```

The code block for changing the costume is in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} section.
