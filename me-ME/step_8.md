## Kostimi (costumes)

Use what you've learnt in this project to make your own band! You can create any instruments you like — look at the available instrument sprites and sounds to get some ideas.

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
set instrument to (\(1\) Piano v)
play note (60) for (0.25) beats
```

Your instruments don't have to be realistic though. For example, you could make a piano made out of muffins!

You can use more sprites from the library, and you can also paint your own sprites!

## title: Zašto moj lik 'skače' kada mijenja kostim?

Pri kreiranju svog lika, možeš primijetiti da, kada klikneš na njega, lik 'skače' dok mijenja kostim. To je zato što dva kostima nisu centrirana na istom mjestu.

To fix this, make sure that the centres of your sprite's costumes are the same.

If you have a microphone, you can record your own sounds, and you can even use a webcam to hit your instruments!
