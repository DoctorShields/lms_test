You can change how your singer sprite looks when it's clicked by creating a new costume. Click on the Costumes tab, and you'll see the singer costume.

The names of the costumes aren't very helpful at the moment. Type into the text boxes of the costumes to change their names to 'not singing' and 'singing'.

Now that you have two different costumes for your singer, you can choose which costume is displayed! Add these two code blocks to your singer sprite:

```blocks3
quando este ator for clicado
+ mude para a fantasia (cantando v)
toque o som (singer1 v) até o fim
+ mude para a fantasia (não cantando v)
```

The code block for changing the costume is in the `Looks`{:class="block3looks"} section.
